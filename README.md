# medical_store_management_system
The purpose of this project is to build a management system for medical store's by which 
they can complete their internal tasks. Medical store contains a lot of medicines and they are 
apperantly located in diiferent places in store. As a human being it is pretty much hard to 
find a specific medicine in a short time. By this application, store management will be able to find 
a specific medicine along with other information. With this core features this system also allows 
store management system to create, update, delete, store a user information, an order, medicicine etc. 
And this system also allows to view sales statistics of the store in a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly basis. 
It has also a feature to view a specific salesman's sales statistics. This is ongoing project, most of the 
features has been implemented and few are left. I am still working on it.
